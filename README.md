Pronouns she/her

Hello, I'm Anne. 

I'm a software engineer, infrastructure engineer and hacker.

I'm currently working on writing Kernel patches, automating my environment with Ansible and Terraform and making dev environments with Nix. I'm currently learning embedded Linux development. 

I love to learn about low level software development, hacking techniques and microarchitectures. 

Fun fact: my username comes from Retpoline, a mitigation for branch target injection that was discovered on the Meltdown/Spectre vulnerabilities. 

Reach me at retpolanne@posteo.net.
